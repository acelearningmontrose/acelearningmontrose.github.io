        Venus Cariazo, Teacher<br/>
        I have my Master’s degree in Education and my Bachelors in Computer Information Systems<br/>
        I have twin boys who are 7 years old. Active, Energetic, and they keep me on my toes!<br/>
        My passion is to see my students thrive and succeed in their education.  The ideal balance is to have my students see education as learning a skill such as learning to play the piano or learning to play a new sport.  The time and effort to practice and play.
